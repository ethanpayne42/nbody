### information about the code

This code was written for ASP3012 Computational Lab 2, and will solve
the equation of motion of a particle in a Keplerian potential, given the
required initial condtions in terms of the eccentricity, e, and the timestep
for the integrator.

### Running the code

In order to run the code, the user simply needs to first compile the code.
This is done by simply executing
```
make
```
in the folder where the code was extracted. Then the user can run the
code with
```
./nbody
```
which begins the code, with the user then required to input the eccentricity and
timestep, with an example shown below:
```
 Please enter e and dt
0.7 0.01
```
Following this, the code will present the output of the angular momentum vector,
and the total energy of the test particle in orbit. The result is saved in
`results.out`.

### Plotting

To plot the result, simply run
```
python plotter.py
```
to plot the orbit in the x-y plane. If the user moves files with dt=0.01, 0.02,
and 0.04 into files called `results-dt****.out` where `****` correspond to the
timestep, then the user can plot the convergence to the exact energy and the
conservation of angular momentum as functions of time, by simply running
```
python converge.py
```
The command
```
python t_plotter.py
```
will make the same plots but only for the `results.out` file.
